# Autopsy-Cyber-Forensics-Report

In this project, I leveraged digital forensic tools within the Kali Linux platform, including Autopsy, to investigate a fraudulent scheme perpetrated by members of a credit union. The investigation focused on uncovering and presenting evidence of theft and conspiracy, ensuring the findings could be utilized in a legal setting.

Case Summary:
The investigation centered on allegations of financial fraud and conspiracy within a credit union. The primary objective was to identify the involved parties, document their actions, and establish a timeline of events leading to the fraudulent activities.

# Tools and Equipment Used:

Kali Linux: Served as the primary platform for digital forensic analysis.

Autopsy: Used to analyze digital artifacts, extract evidence, and create a comprehensive timeline.
These tools were instrumental in collecting, processing, and presenting digital evidence in a structured manner.

Device Under Investigation:
Analysis focused on specific devices associated with the suspects, including their make, model, serial numbers, and any distinctive features or modifications. This detailed documentation was crucial for legal proceedings.

# Significant Findings:

Digital Evidence: Key artifacts, such as emails, SMS correspondence, and financial transaction records, were uncovered, providing insight into the fraudulent activities.

GPS Data: Location services data was analyzed to track the suspects' movements, correlating them with the timeline of fraudulent transactions.

Plot Timeline: A detailed timeline of events was constructed, including timestamps, to map the sequence of fraudulent activities and conspiracies.

Derived Conclusions:
Based on the evidence gathered, conclusions were drawn about the suspects’ involvement in the fraudulent scheme. Each conclusion was supported by digital artifacts and corroborated by a timeline analysis.

# Final Deliverable:
A comprehensive forensic report was compiled, detailing the investigation process, findings, and conclusions. The report was structured to meet legal standards, making it suitable for presentation in court.
